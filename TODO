Part 1 (general fixes)
- Support more color formats (like luminance-alpha)
  - Treat alpha as a separate entity
- Allow planar images
  - `color::proxy` has to reply on this, so `color::types::pointer` is wrong.
    It should probably go into image::

Part 2 (opportunity for library extensions)
- Provide customization for color conversion
