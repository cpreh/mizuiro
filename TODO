Part 1 (general fixes)
- Support more color formats (like luminance-alpha)
  - Rename gray to luminance
  - Treat alpha as a separate entity
- Allow heterogeneous colors
  - Heterogeneous colors cannot be accessed via `access::normal` (probably)
  - Get rid of every hardcoded bit that uses `homogeneous` and the element_count
- Allow planar images
  - `color::proxy` has to reply on this, so `color::types::pointer` is wrong.
    It should probably go into image::
- Provide getter/setter for color channels like the constructors do
- Make sure that views can be used with almost any types (that are not colors)
- `image::detail::stride_pointer` is an ugly hack that has to go in favour of more traits

Part 2 (opportunity for library extensions)
- Provide more traits so that users can use their own color and view concepts
- Provide customization for color conversion
